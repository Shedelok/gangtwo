# Ideas

- Chip layout: show 4 chips in a single row (currently wraps freely). Fix in `PlayerSeat.tsx`.
- Restart / Stop Game buttons: fix margin between them — currently positioned with fixed `right` offsets that look uneven. Fix in `App.tsx`.
- "Move to next round": replace checkbox+label with a proper button. Fix in `PlayerSeat.tsx`.
