# UI Details

The table is displayed as a green oval in the center of the screen. Each player sees themself at the bottom and all
other
players are seated clockwise, but the order is the same for everyone (meaning the player who seats clockwise to the
current player
sees the current player counter-clockwise next to themself).

For each player there is their name, cards and chips that are displayed where the player seats.

## Cards

The cards are displayed face up for the current player and face down for everyone else.

## Chips

The chips are displayed as circles of the designated color with a digit in the middle. The color of the chips should
always stay the same, even after the corresponding round is over, chips remain their color.

The chips of the same color are always sorted by value ascending when are put next to each other.

The chips of different colors are always sorted by their corresponding round number ascending when are put next to each
other.

## Checkbox

The players can only see their own checkbox for being ready for the next round and don't see whether other players have
their checkbox checked or not.
